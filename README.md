# ✨ Amanpreet Kaur's Web Nook 💻🌸

Hey there! I'm Amanpreet — a curious final-year CSE student who likes building things, breaking stuff (to learn), and occasionally pretending I understand AI. 😄

This little webpage is my digital home on the web — short, sweet, and all me.

## 🌻 About Me (in less than 4 bullet points)

- 🎓 Studying Computer Science & Engineering
- 🤖 Training in AI, stats, and software engineering (yes, I read research papers... sometimes)
- 🔍 Always exploring new tools and solving puzzles that make me go “hmm”
- 🌈 Believer in clean code, caffeine-fueled nights, and lifelong learning

## 🚧 What Is This Repo?

This is my minimalist personal website built using:

- `HTML` (because structure is everything)
- `CSS` (just enough to make it look like I tried)
- `✨ vibes`

Live site coming soon™ — or hosted via GitHub Pages if I remember to push it.
